# KotaDB Marketing Brief

## Product Snapshot

- Managed SaaS version of KotaDB delivers a hosted, always-current codebase intelligence layer for Claude Code, Codex, and similar CLI-based coding agents.
- Core engine converts software repositories into a queryable knowledge graph with symbol extraction, dependency mapping, and impact analysis baked in.
- Self-hosted, MIT-licensed option remains available via GitHub, but this site’s primary job is to drive signups for the managed service.

## Audience & Desired Outcome

- Primary buyers: engineering leaders, platform teams, and AI tooling owners responsible for velocity and reliability in large codebases.
- Secondary users: senior developers and automation specialists evaluating tools for their agent workflows.
- Desired action: click the SaaS “Get Started” CTA that links to the KotaDB dashboard login/signup flow.

## Voice & Tone

- Enterprise-first polish with a casual, Gen-Z edge; confident and modern without heavy jargon or sarcasm.
- Emphasize clarity and momentum; short, punchy sentences supported by occasional conversational flourishes.
- Avoid deep developer lingo—focus on business outcomes (certainty, speed, safety) rather than API minutiae on the main page.

## Positioning Pillars

1. **Intelligence Layer for Agents** – KotaDB is the hosted knowledge graph that gives Claude Code/Codex high quality context to avoid context-filling grep, find, or awk searches.
2. **Enterprise-Ready Control** – Managed onboarding, API key governance, quotas, and multi-tenant safety built in; open-source transparency via GitHub for those who want to inspect the code.
3. **High-Trust Operations** – Layered safety wrappers, zero external DB dependency, and production-hardening (tests, WAL durability) convey resilience without exposing raw benchmarks.

## Messaging Guardrails

- Lead with pain/solution storytelling (context loss, risky refactors, slow answers) instead of feature checklists.
- Keep roadmap discussion subtle. No future promises on the hero; optional light mention in lower-page content.
- Exclude hard numbers for latency/throughput until approved.
- Comparisons remain generic—no competitor names or logos.

## Pricing & Packaging Notes

- Feature the SaaS tiers prominently: Individual $39/month, Team $59 per seat/month.
- Encourage SaaS signup while giving curious teams a path to inspect the GitHub repo.
- Leave room to reference upcoming managed-only capabilities (placeholders for analytics, team workspaces, etc.).

## CTA & Navigation Cues

- Primary CTA text: variants of “Get Started” / “Start KotaDB” that route to the dashboard login.
- Secondary links: documentation, GitHub repository (to review the code), contact/support email.
- Hero subtitle and mid-page reminders should reinforce the hosted intelligence story and repeat the CTA.

## Open Items / Placeholders

- Specific managed-only feature callouts (e.g., analytics dashboard, workspace sharing) pending confirmation.
- Security/compliance assurances to be added once requirements are defined.
- FAQ content to capture security, roadmap, and deployment questions when ready.
